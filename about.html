        Reebotic is founded by a group of veteran Silicon Valley roboticists. We
        believe that in the near future, robots will become important in every
        facet of our daily lives, going beyond just vacuuming the floor and powering
        factories. We provide AI-powered robotic services and solutions to a broad
        range of industries and applications. Our high-performance, all-weather
        and all-terrain robot platforms are built on over 12 years experiences
        making robots for law enforcement, firefighters, and other public safety
        personnel who perform some of the toughest missions in the world. And our
        team has decades of experiences in high-quality products manufacturing.
        Our goal is to build robots that not only can save lives, but can also make
        this world a better place to live!
