        This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for Reebotic Inc and our website:
         http://www.reebotic.com. This privacy notice applies solely to information collected
         by this website, except where stated otherwise. It will notify you of the following:
         <li>What information we collect;</li>
         <li>With whom it is shared;</li>
         <li>How it can be corrected;</li>
         <li>How it is secured;</li>
         <li>How policy changes will be communicated; and</li>
         <li>How to address concerns over misuse of personal data.</li>
      </p>
      <h5>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing </h5>
      <p>
         We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site.
         We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us
         via email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this
         information to anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you
        contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside
        of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g.,
        to ship an order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to
        tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this
        privacy policy.
      </p>
      <h5>Your Access to and Control Over Information</h5>
      <p>
        You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the
        following at any time by contacting us via the email address or phone number
        provided on our website:
        <li>See what data we have about you, if any.</li>
        <li>Change/correct any data we have about you.</li>
        <li>Have us delete any data we have about you.</li>
        <li>Express any concern you have about our use of your data</li>
      </p>
      <h5>Registration</h5>
      <p>
        In order to better use this website, a user should first complete the registration
        form. During registration a user is required to give certain information
        (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact you
        about the products/services on our site in which you have expressed interest.
        At your option, you may also provide demographic information (such as gender
        or age) about yourself, but it is not required.
      </p>
      <h5>Orders</h5>
      <p>
        We request information from you on our order form. To buy from us, you
        must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial
        information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information
        is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble
        processing an order, we'll use this information to contact you.
      </p>
      <h5>Sharing</h5>
      <p>We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers.
        This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual
        person.
      </p>
      <p>And/or: </p>
      <p>We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing
        company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain,
        share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary
        purposes beyond filling your order.
      </p>
      <p>And/or: </p>
      <p>
        We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user
        signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information
        that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties
        are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the
        purpose of providing these services.
      </p>
      <h5>Security</h5>
      <p>
        We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive
        information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that
        information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can
        verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web
        browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online,
        we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information
        to perform a specific job (e.g. billing or customer service) are granted
        access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers on
        which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
      </p>
      <h5>Cookies</h5>
      <p>
        We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a
        site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and
        identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie
        to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once,
        thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track
        and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our
        site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable
        information on our site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (e.g., advertisers).
        However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
      </p>
      <h5>Links</h5>
      <p>
        This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are
        not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites.
        We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read
        the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable
        information.
      </p>
      <h5>Surveys & Contests</h5>
      <p>
        From time-to-time our site requests information via surveys or contests.
        Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you
        may choose whether or not to participate and therefore disclose this information.
        Information requested may include contact information (such as name and
        shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).
        Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.
        Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving
        the use and satisfaction of this site.
